1
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:13,792
You probably don&#39;t realize

2
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:16,837
that right now, you&#39;re actually looking at something quite rare.

3
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:22,148
Because I am a millennial computer scientist book author

4
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:24,027
standing on a TEDx stage,

5
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:26,579
and yet, I&#39;ve never had a social media account.

6
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,147
How this happened was actually somewhat random.

7
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:33,258
Social media first came onto my radar when I was at college,

8
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:34,692
my sophomore year of college,

9
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:37,149
this is when Facebook arrived at our campus.

10
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:41,118
And at the time, which was right after the first dotcom bust,

11
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,091
I had had a dorm room business, I&#39;d had to shut it down in the bust,

12
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:47,909
and then, suddenly, this other kid from Harvard, named Mark,

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,078
had this product called Facebook and people being excited about it.

14
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,049
So in sort of a fit of somewhat immature professional jealousy,

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,010
I said, &quot;I&#39;m not going to use this thing.

16
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:59,091
I won&#39;t help this kid&#39;s business; whatever&#39;s going to amount to.&quot;

17
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,369
As I go along my life, I look up not long later,

18
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,750
and I see everyone I know is hooked on this thing.

19
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,300
And from the clarity you can get

20
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:07,892
when you have some objectivity, some perspective on it,

21
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:10,282
I realized this seems a little bit dangerous.

22
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:11,683
So I never signed up.

23
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:14,154
I&#39;ve never had a social media account since.

24
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:17,214
So I&#39;m here for two reasons; I want to deliver two messages.

25
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:19,134
The first message I want to deliver

26
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:22,734
is that even though I&#39;ve never had a social media account,

27
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:25,055
I&#39;m OK, you don&#39;t have to worry.

28
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:28,234
It turns out I still have friends,

29
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:30,245
I still know what&#39;s going on in the world;

30
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:31,824
as a computer scientist

31
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,324
I still collaborate with people all around the world,

32
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:37,414
I&#39;m still regularly exposed serendipitously to interesting ideas,

33
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:41,065
and I rarely describe myself as lacking entertainment options.

34
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:44,164
So I&#39;ve been OK, but I&#39;d go even farther and say

35
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:49,138
not only I am OK without social media but I think I&#39;m actually better off.

36
00:01:49,497 --> 00:01:54,046
I think I&#39;m happier, I think I find more sustainability in my life,

37
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,773
and I think I&#39;ve been more successful professionally

38
00:01:56,774 --> 00:01:58,847
because I don&#39;t use social media.

39
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,736
So my second goal here on stage

40
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:05,478
is try to convince more of you to believe the same thing.

41
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:08,436
Let&#39;s see if I could actually convince more of you

42
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:11,477
that you too would be better off if you quit social media.

43
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:15,026
So, if the theme of this TEDx event is &quot;Future Tense,&quot;

44
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:18,036
I guess, in other words, this would be my vision of the future,

45
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,047
would be one in which fewer people actually use social media.

46
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,847
That&#39;s a big claim, I think I need to back it up.

47
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:25,296
So I thought, what I would do

48
00:02:25,297 --> 00:02:28,648
is take the three most common objections I hear

49
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,448
when I suggest to people that they quit social media,

50
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:34,568
and then for each of these objections, I&#39;ll try to defuse the hype

51
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,250
and see if I can actually push in some more reality.

52
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,170
This is the first most common objection I hear.

53
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,035
That&#39;s not a hermit,

54
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:47,649
that&#39;s actually a hipster web developer down from 8th Street; I&#39;m not sure.

55
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:50,360
Hipster or hermit? Sometimes it&#39;s hard to tell.

56
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,449
This first objection goes as follows,

57
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:56,902
&quot;Cal, social media is one of the fundamental technologies

58
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:58,073
of the 21st century.

59
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:02,440
To reject social media would be an act of extreme [bloodism].

60
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,599
It would be like riding to work on a horse or using a rotary phone.

61
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,860
I can&#39;t take such a big stance in my life.&quot;

62
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:12,411
My reaction to that objection is I think that is nonsense.

63
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:16,020
Social media is not a fundamental technology.

64
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:18,051
It leverages some fundamental technologies,

65
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:20,771
but it&#39;s better understood as this.

66
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,000
Which is to say, it&#39;s a source of entertainment,

67
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:25,471
it&#39;s an entertainment product.

68
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,834
The way that technologist Jaron Lanier puts it

69
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:31,980
is that these companies offer you shiny treats

70
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:35,831
in exchange for minutes of your attention and bites of your personal data,

71
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,770
which can then be packaged up and sold.

72
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,007
So to say that you don&#39;t use social media should not be a large social stance,

73
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:46,681
it&#39;s just rejecting one form of entertainment for others.

74
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:49,027
There should be no more controversial than saying,

75
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:52,047
&quot;I don&#39;t like newspapers, I like to get my news from magazines,&quot;

76
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:55,945
or &quot;I prefer to watch cable series, as opposed to network television series.&quot;

77
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:58,585
It&#39;s not a major political or social stance

78
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,875
to say you don&#39;t use this product.

79
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:04,294
My use of the slot machine image up here also is not accidental

80
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:07,224
because if you look a little bit closer at these technologies,

81
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:09,714
it&#39;s not just that they&#39;re a source of entertainment

82
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,347
but they&#39;re a somewhat unsavory source of entertainment.

83
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:15,036
We now know that many of the major social media companies

84
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:17,714
hire individuals called attention engineers,

85
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:20,204
who borrow principles from Las Vegas casino gambling,

86
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:21,483
among other places,

87
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:25,385
to try to make these products as addictive as possible.

88
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,587
That is the desired use case of these products:

89
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:31,432
is that you use it in an addictive fashion because that maximizes the profit

90
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:34,893
that can be extracted from your attention and data.

91
00:04:34,894 --> 00:04:36,685
So it&#39;s not a fundamental technology,

92
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:39,145
it&#39;s just a source of entertainment, one among many,

93
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,117
and it&#39;s somewhat unsavory if you look a little bit closer.

94
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:44,925
Here&#39;s the second common objection I hear

95
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:47,032
when I suggest that people quit social media.

96
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:48,502
The objection goes as follows,

97
00:04:48,503 --> 00:04:50,324
&quot;Cal, I can&#39;t quit social media

98
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:54,984
because it is vital to my success in the 21st century economy.

99
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:58,545
If I do not have a well-cultivated social media brand,

100
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:01,536
people won&#39;t know who I am, people won&#39;t be able to find me,

101
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:03,348
opportunities won&#39;t come my way,

102
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:06,845
and I will effectively disappear from the economy.&quot;

103
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:09,135
Again my reaction is once again:

104
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:11,986
this objection also is nonsense.

105
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,905
I recently published this book

106
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:19,438
that draws on multiple different strands of evidence

107
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,050
to make the point that, in a competitive 21st century economy,

108
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:26,200
what the market values

109
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:30,502
is the ability to produce things that are rare and are valuable.

110
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:33,601
If you produce something that&#39;s rare and valuable,

111
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:34,987
the market will value that.

112
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:37,787
What the market dismisses, for the most part,

113
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:41,887
are activities that are easy to replicate and produce a small amount of value.

114
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:46,017
Well, social media use is the epitome

115
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:49,292
of an easy to replicate activity that doesn&#39;t produce a lot of value;

116
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:52,387
it&#39;s something that any six-year-old with a smartphone can do.

117
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:53,387
By definition,

118
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:56,499
the market is not going to give a lot of value to those behaviors.

119
00:05:56,619 --> 00:06:00,557
It&#39;s instead going to reward the deep, concentrated work required

120
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:03,938
to build real skills and to apply those skills to produce things

121
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,628
- like a craftsman -

122
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:07,639
that are rare and that are valuable.

123
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,130
To put it another way: if you can write an elegant algorithm,

124
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,648
if you can write a legal brief that can change a case,

125
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,799
if you can write a thousand words of prose

126
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,097
that&#39;s going to fixate a reader right to the end;

127
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:23,870
if you can look at a sea of ambiguous data

128
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,989
and apply statistics, and pull out insights

129
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,999
that could transform a business strategy,

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,020
if you can do these type of activities which require deep work,

131
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:34,352
that produce outcomes that are rare and valuable,

132
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,160
people will find you.

133
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:38,171
You will be able to write your own ticket,

134
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:41,665
and build the foundation of a meaningful and successful professional life,

135
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:45,734
regardless of how many Instagram followers you have.

136
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,235
This is the third comment objection I hear

137
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:53,720
when I suggest to people that they quit social media;

138
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:56,600
in some sense, I think it might be one of the most important.

139
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:58,150
This objection goes as follows,

140
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,741
&quot;Cal, maybe I agree, maybe you&#39;re right; it&#39;s not a fundamental technology.

141
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:06,051
Maybe using social media is not at the core of my professional success.

142
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,421
But, you know what?

143
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:11,700
It&#39;s harmless, I have some fun on it - weird: Twitter&#39;s funny -

144
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:14,091
I don&#39;t even use it that much, I&#39;m a first adopter,

145
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:16,030
it&#39;s kind of interesting to try it out,

146
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:18,642
and maybe I might miss out something if I don&#39;t use it.

147
00:07:18,643 --> 00:07:20,222
What&#39;s the harm?&quot;

148
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:25,022
Again, I look back and I say: this objection also is nonsense.

149
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:29,401
In this case, what it misses is what I think is a very important reality

150
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:31,731
that we need to talk about more frankly,

151
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:34,331
which is that social media brings with it

152
00:07:34,332 --> 00:07:37,402
multiple, well-documented, and significant harms.

153
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:41,392
We actually have to confront these harms head-on

154
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:42,791
when trying to make decisions

155
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:45,643
about whether or not we embrace this technology

156
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:47,583
and let it into our lives.

157
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:50,853
One of these harms that we know this technology brings

158
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:53,603
has to do with your professional success.

159
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:57,503
I just argued before that the ability to focus intensely,

160
00:07:57,504 --> 00:07:59,642
to produce things that are rare and valuable,

161
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:01,605
to hone skills the market place value on,

162
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,785
that this is what will matter in our economy.

163
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:05,555
But right before that,

164
00:08:05,556 --> 00:08:10,523
I argued that social media tools are designed to be addictive.

165
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,361
The actual designed desired-use case of these tools

166
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:15,933
is that you fragment your attention as much as possible

167
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:17,323
throughout your waking hours;

168
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:19,473
that&#39;s how these tools are designed to use.

169
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:21,893
We have a growing amount of research which tells us

170
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:24,545
that if you spend large portions of your day

171
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,123
in a state of fragmented attention -

172
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:29,708
large portions of your day, breaking up your attention,

173
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,346
to take a quick glance, to just check, - &quot;Let me quickly look at Instagram&quot; -

174
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:36,950
that this can permanently reduce your capacity for concentration.

175
00:08:37,414 --> 00:08:40,142
In other words, you could permanently reduce your capacity

176
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:42,124
to do exactly the type of deep effort

177
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,355
that we&#39;re finding to be more and more necessary

178
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:47,256
in an increasingly competitive economy.

179
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:48,996
So social media use is not harmless,

180
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:51,476
it can actually have a significant negative impact

181
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:53,845
on your ability to thrive in the economy.

182
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:57,291
I&#39;m especially worried about this when we look at the younger generation,

183
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:59,493
which is the most saturated in this technology.

184
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:02,537
If you lose your ability to sustain concentration,

185
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:06,408
you&#39;re going to become less and less relevant to this economy.

186
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:09,832
There&#39;s also psychological harms that are well documented

187
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,038
that social media brings, that we do need to address.

188
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,448
We know from the research literature that the more you use social media,

189
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:19,708
the more likely you are to feel lonely or isolated.

190
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,407
We know that the constant exposure

191
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:27,734
to your friends carefully curated, positive portrayals of their life

192
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:31,319
can leave you to feel inadequate, and can increase rates of depression.

193
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:35,558
And something I think we&#39;re going to be hearing more about in the near future

194
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,909
is that there&#39;s a fundamental mismatch

195
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,950
between the way our brains are wired

196
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,429
and this behavior of exposing yourself to stimuli

197
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,378
with intermittent rewards throughout all of your waking hours.

198
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:49,838
It&#39;s one thing to spend a couple of hours at a slot machine in Las Vegas,

199
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,099
but if you bring one with you, and you pull that handle all day long,

200
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,379
from when you wake up to when you go to bed: we&#39;re not wired from it.

201
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,720
It short-circuits the brain,

202
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:00,736
and we&#39;re starting to find it has actual cognitive consequences,

203
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:04,625
one of them being this sort of pervasive background hum of anxiety.

204
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,879
The canary in the coal mine for this issue is actually college campuses.

205
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,419
If you talk to mental health experts on college campuses, they&#39;ll tell you

206
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,919
that along with the rise of ubiquitous smartphone use

207
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,460
and social media use among the students on the campus,

208
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:22,629
came an explosion of anxiety-related disorders on those campuses.

209
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,299
That&#39;s the canary in the coal mine.

210
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,969
This type of behavior is a mismatch for our brain wiring

211
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,570
and can make you feel miserable.

212
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:32,161
So there&#39;s real cost to social media use;

213
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:35,464
which means when you&#39;re trying to decide, &quot;Should I use this or not?&quot;,

214
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:37,140
saying it&#39;s harmless is not enough.

215
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,710
You actually have to identify a significantly positive, clear benefit

216
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:45,962
that can outweigh these potential, completely non-trivial harms.

217
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:48,911
People often ask,

218
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:51,561
&quot;OK, but what is life like without social media?&quot;

219
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:54,141
That can actually be a little bit scary to think about.

220
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:56,471
According to people who went through this process,

221
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,147
there can be a few difficult weeks.

222
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,251
It actually is like a true detox process.

223
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:02,981
The first two weeks can be uncomfortable:

224
00:11:02,982 --> 00:11:06,152
you feel a little bit anxious, you feel like you&#39;re missing a limb.

225
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:08,091
But after that, things settle down,

226
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:11,903
and actually, life after social media can be quite positive.

227
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:16,312
There&#39;s two things I can report back from the world of no social media use.

228
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,347
First, it can be quite productive.

229
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:24,353
I&#39;m a professor at a research institution, I&#39;ve written five books,

230
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:27,176
I rarely work past 5 pm on a weekday.

231
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,583
Part of the way I&#39;m trying to able to pull that off

232
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:35,334
is because it turns out, if you treat your attention with respect,

233
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:37,965
- so you don&#39;t fragment it; you allow it to stay whole,

234
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,535
you preserve your concentration -

235
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:40,806
when it comes time to work

236
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:43,685
you can do one thing after another, and do it with intensity,

237
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,465
and intensity can be traded for time.

238
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:48,355
It&#39;s surprising how much you can get done in a eight-hour day

239
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:52,135
if you&#39;re able to give each thing intense concentration after another.

240
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:55,784
Something else I can report back from life without social media

241
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:59,866
is that outside of work, things can be quite peaceful.

242
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:03,657
I often joke I&#39;d be very comfortable being a 1930s farmer,

243
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:05,544
because if you look at my leisure time,

244
00:12:05,545 --> 00:12:07,655
I read the newspaper while the sun comes up;

245
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:09,315
I listen to baseball on the radio;

246
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:11,325
I honest-to-god sit in a leather chair

247
00:12:11,326 --> 00:12:14,855
and read hardcover books at night after my kids go to bed.

248
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:17,915
It sounds old-fashioned, but they were onto something back then.

249
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:23,527
It&#39;s actually a restorative, peaceful way to actually spend your time out of work.

250
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:25,837
You don&#39;t have the constant hum of stimuli,

251
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:29,168
and the background hum of anxiety that comes along with that.

252
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:32,419
So life without social media is really not so bad.

253
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,818
If you pull together these threads, you see my full argument

254
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:39,268
that not everyone, but certainly much more people than right now,

255
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:41,728
much more people should not be using social media.

256
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:44,368
That&#39;s because we can first, to summarize,

257
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,059
discard with the main concerns

258
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,453
that it&#39;s a fundamental technology you have to use.

259
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:50,669
Nonsense: it&#39;s a slot machine in your phone.

260
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,870
We can discard with this notion that you won&#39;t get a job without it.

261
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:56,629
Nonsense: anything a six-year-old with a smartphone can do

262
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,678
is not going to be what the market rewards.

263
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,869
And then I emphasized the point that there&#39;s real harms with it.

264
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,139
So it&#39;s not just harmless.

265
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,533
You really would have to have a significant benefit

266
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,854
before you would say this trade-off is worth it.

267
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,510
Finally I noted, that life without social media:

268
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:13,220
there&#39;s real positives associated with it.

269
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:17,070
So I&#39;m hoping that when many of you actually go through this same calculus,

270
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:20,109
you&#39;ll at least consider the perspective I&#39;m making right now,

271
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,849
which is: many more people would be much better off

272
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,649
if they didn&#39;t use this technology.

273
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,040
Some of you might disagree,

274
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:31,231
some of you might have scathing but accurate critiques

275
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:32,370
of me and my points,

276
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:34,790
and of course, I welcome all negative feedback.

277
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,239
I just ask that you direct your comments towards Twitter.

278
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,490
Thank you.

279
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:40,831
(Applause)
