<h2>Heading 2</h2>

<p>This is a Raw HTML editor that saves your HTML exactly as you enter it.
This means that even malformed HTML tags will be saved and rendered as-is.
There is no way to switch between Raw and Visual Text editor types, so be
sure this is the editor you should be using!</p>

<p>I am normal</p>
<p style="color:red;">I am red</p>
<p style="color:blue;">I am blue</p>
<p style="font-size:50px;">I am big</p>
